# Docker Container for the Google App Engine Go SDK

[![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/kujenga/docker-gae-go.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://hub.docker.com/r/kujenga/docker-gae-go/)

The release of macOS Sierra broke the version of Go used by the most recent App Engine SDKs, as [is being discussed](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine-go/4AKjwr5d5a8) in the [google-appengine-go](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-appengine-go) Google Group.

A suggested workaround is to use a docker container to run the App Engine SDKs in the meantime. This repository is intended to serve that purpose.

## Usage

Pull the image with:

```bash
docker pull kujenga/docker-gae-go
```

Included in this repository is a script, `run.sh`, which can be used to run the container in conjunction with App Engine apps living within your local `GOPATH`. It's usage is very similar to the `dev_appserver.py` tool. The arguments passed into it are the relative paths of any number of App Engine applications.

For example, if the `run.sh` script lives at `$GOPATH/src/github.com/run.sh` and you want to run three app engine applications within the `myorg` organization, you would use the following command.

```bash
./run.sh \
    myorg/app1/default/app.yaml \
    myorg/app1/worker/app.yaml \
    myorg/app2/app.yaml
```

### Note:
At the current time I'm not able to conenct to the admin console from `localhost` outside of the container, since it's listening on a local port within the container. SSH port forwarding may be of user here, though I haven't tried it.
